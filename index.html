        <h2>HTML</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is a language used in web development to create the structure of a webpage</li>
          <li> HTML elements work together to build the structure of a webpage and provide a framework that makes it easy to navigate as a user</li>
          <li>The head element contains information about the webpage</li>
          <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user</li>
          <li>An HTML attribute defines additional information about an element and are defined at the beginning element</li>
          <li>Elements that are nested inside other elements are called child elements</li>
          <li>The element that holds all the children is known as the parent element</li>
          <li>When working with visible HTML elements, the content is placed between an opening tag and a closing tag</li>
          <li>An element refers to the entire element from opening tag to closing tag</li>
          <li>A tag refers only to what appears inside the angle brackets</li>
          <li>HTML elements *are* case-sensitive</li>

        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>A developer uses inline CSS, internal style sheets and external CSS style sheets when they want to style a webpage</li>
          <li>The most common way to style a webpage is by using external CSS style sheets because it allows developers to keep all their CSS rules in separate files, making design changes easier</li>
          <li>A declaration contains the CSS property we want to apply and the value of the property</li>
          <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element</li>
          <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element</li>
          <li>Every HTML element is a box. In the center is the content, surrounded by padding, a border and a margin, in that order. This is often referred to as the CSS box model</li>
          <li>Declarations are *not* case-sensitive</li>
